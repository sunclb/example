## As most of the functions are writen in python and some of them shareing the same library, so the docker run is designed below way
1. Docker image itself is a python environment, when run the docker, need to mount the volumn to WORKDIR in docker
2. put all function python files to the mounted volumn to allow docker to see the scripts
3. Run docker with specify --env function_file=target_function_py_file

do it this way can significately eliminate image built time and speed up development and debug process
